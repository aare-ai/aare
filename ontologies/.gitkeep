# Place custom ontology JSON files in this directory
# Example: my-custom-ontology.json
#
# Ontology files must have the following structure:
# {
#   "name": "my-custom-ontology",
#   "version": "1.0.0",
#   "description": "Description of your ontology",
#   "constraints": [...],
#   "extractors": {...}
# }
#
# See README.md for full documentation on creating custom ontologies.
